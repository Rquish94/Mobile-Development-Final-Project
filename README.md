# Mobile-Development-Final-Project
This was my final project for mobile development. This was when i first was beginning my CS major.

The overall purpose was to make an app, it could have any usecase but needed to be functional. 
My app was about net neutrality and simply a picture of ajit pai and asked for input on who the person is. 

I was never to wild about java but like the idea of mobile development. This could lead me into looking into GO.
Even trying to open and run this, my gradle is giving me issues. Android studio SUCKS!!!!
